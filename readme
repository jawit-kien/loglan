Here you have the sources. 
     They are in Unix format. Use unix2dos to read them in DOS.

Unix users:
  You should build
	1. the crosscompiler F2C used by make to construct loglan
	2. loglan i.e. pass1
	3. gen i.e. pass2
	4. int i.e. the executor
You have four directories. In each directory locate the file 
    makefile
- do a copy of it
- modify the makefile in accordance to your equipment and needs
- execute:
      make
- store the resulting executable where you wish to keep executables

Attention!
  in INT you should build "int" and "herc"
do:
	make   --in order to make int
	make herc    --in order to make herc a graphic partner of int
__________________________
New: new version "xint" of int and "xiuwgraf" are available. Not integrated yet.
